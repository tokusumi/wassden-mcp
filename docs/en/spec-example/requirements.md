## 0. Summary

Agent-oriented Spec-Driven Development Support MCP Tool

- Supports high-quality spec creation for Agent development requests through staged prompt generation
- Provides appropriate prompts at each stage: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Code
- Forms PDCA cycle through validation execution and regeneration instructions for deliverables
- Minimizes change impact propagation through traceability management

## 1. Glossary

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Standard protocol for Agent-IDE tool integration
- **Agent**: AI development assistants like Claude Code
- **Spec-Driven Development**: Specification-driven development methodology
- **Prompt Generation**: Automatic generation of work instruction prompts for Agents
- **Validation**: Deliverable quality verification and feedback functionality
- **Traceability**: Bidirectional relationship management between requirements-design-tasks
- **PDCA**: Plan-Do-Check-Act continuous improvement cycle
- **EARS**: Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax requirement description format
- **WBS**: Work Breakdown Structure

## 2. Scope

### In Scope

- Agent prompt generation functionality (Requirements/Design/Tasks/Code stages)
- Deliverable validation functionality and regeneration instruction functionality
- User question generation functionality when information is insufficient
- Traceability management and change impact analysis functionality
- Agent work quality improvement guidance functionality

### Out of Scope

- Direct file generation/editing functionality
- Features for non-Agent clients
- Actual code implementation functionality
- Project management functionality
- Version control functionality

## 3. Constraints

- Must operate in Python 3.12+ environment
- FastMCP usage required
- Guaranteed operation in Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code MCP compatible versions
- Prompt responses within 10,000 characters
- Real-time response performance (< 1 second)

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-01**: Response time < 1 second (prompt generation and verification processing)
- **NFR-02**: Prompt quality consistency (EARS compliant, WBS compliant)
- **NFR-03**: Traceability completeness (requirements ⇔ design ⇔ tasks bidirectional tracking)
- **NFR-04**: Agent guidance clarity (work procedures and precautions)
- **NFR-05**: Comprehensive error handling (invalid input and incomplete data support)

## 5. KPI / Acceptance Criteria

- **KPI-01**: Agent work prompt generation success rate 99% or higher
- **KPI-02**: Deliverable validation accuracy 95% or higher (minimize false positives/negatives)
- **KPI-03**: Traceability completeness 100% (no missing or circular dependencies)
- **KPI-04**: Agent work efficiency improvement 50% or higher (compared to conventional methods)
- **KPI-05**: Information shortage detection rate 90% or higher (appropriate question generation)

## 6. Functional Requirements

- **REQ-01**: The system shall analyze information sufficiency and generate user question prompts for missing information when receiving initial requests from Agents.
- **REQ-02**: The system shall provide Agent prompts for generating EARS format requirements.md when sufficient information is provided.
- **REQ-03**: The system shall verify structure and content and generate correction instruction prompts when receiving requirements.md with defects.
- **REQ-04**: The system shall provide Agent prompts for generating design.md based on valid requirements.md.
- **REQ-05**: The system shall verify structure, content, and traceability and generate correction instruction prompts when receiving design.md with defects.
- **REQ-06**: The system shall provide Agent prompts for generating WBS format tasks.md based on valid design.md.
- **REQ-07**: The system shall verify structure, content, and dependencies and generate correction instruction prompts when receiving tasks.md with defects.
- **REQ-08**: The system shall provide Agent prompts (with precautions) for staged code implementation based on valid tasks.md.
- **REQ-09**: The system shall identify affected items and generate prompts for concurrent modification when any spec changes occur.
- **REQ-10**: The system shall provide current traceability status in report format.

## 7. Testing Requirements

- **TR-01**: Prompt generation content verification (expected instructions and precautions included)
- **TR-02**: Validation accuracy verification (appropriate judgment in normal/abnormal cases)
- **TR-03**: Question generation quality verification (information shortage detection and appropriate question generation)
- **TR-04**: Traceability management accuracy verification (relationship completeness and change impact analysis)
- **TR-05**: Performance testing (response time requirement confirmation)
- **TR-06**: Prompt character limit testing (within 10,000 characters)
- **TR-07**: Agent integration testing (actual Agent response confirmation)
