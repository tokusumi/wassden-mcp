Technology stack, programming language, and framework\n2. Target users and intended audience\n3. Technical and business constraints\n4. Project scope and exclusions\n5. Sufficient detail (description of 100+ characters)\n\n### If information is insufficient\nPlease ask specific questions about the missing information.",

Summary\nProvide a 3-5 sentence project overview\n\n### 1. Glossary\n- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: [Definition]\n- **Project-specific terms**: [Definition]\n\n### 2. Scope\n#### In Scope\n- [What will be done]\n\n#### Out of Scope\n- [What will not be done]\n\n### 3. Constraints\n- [Technical constraints]\n- [Business constraints]\n- [Environmental constraints]\n\n### 4. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)\n- **NFR-01**: [Performance requirements]\n- **NFR-02**: [Security requirements]\n- **NFR-03**: [Availability requirements]\n- **NFR-04**: [Maintainability requirements]\n- **NFR-05**: [Other requirements]\n\n### 5. KPI / Acceptance Criteria\n- **KPI-01**: [Measurable success metric]\n- **KPI-02**: [Measurable success metric]\n- [Additional KPIs...]\n\n### 6. Functional Requirements (EARS)\nFollowing Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax (EARS):\n- **REQ-01**: The system shall, when [condition], perform [action]\n- **REQ-02**: The system shall, when [condition], perform [action]\n- [Additional requirements...]\n\n## Creation Guidelines\n1. Create each REQ-ID in sequence (REQ-01, REQ-02...)\n2. Functional requirements should follow \"The system shall...\" format\n3. Use measurable and verifiable expressions\n4. Avoid ambiguous expressions (\"appropriately\", \"sufficiently\", etc.)\n5. Word count: approximately 2000-5000 characters\n\n---\n\nFollowing the above guidelines, please either create the requirements.md file directly if information is sufficient, or ask questions if information is missing."
